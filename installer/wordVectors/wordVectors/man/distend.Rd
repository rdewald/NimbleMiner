\title{Compress or expand a vector space model along a vector.}
\usage{
distend(matrix, vector, multiplier)
}
\arguments{
\item{matrix}{A matrix or VectorSpaceModel}

\item{vector}{A vector (or an object coercable to a vector, see project)
of the same length as the VectorSpaceModel.}

\item{multiplier}{A scaling factor. See below.}
}
\value{
A new matrix or VectorSpaceModel of the same dimensions as `matrix`,
distended along the vector 'vector' by factor 'multiplier'.

See `project` for more details and usage.
}
\description{
This is an experimental function that might be useful sometimes.
'Reject' flatly eliminates a particular dimension from a vectorspace, essentially
squashing out a single dimension; 'distend' gives finer grained control, making it
possible to stretch out or compress in the same space. High values of 'multiplier'
make a given vector more prominent; 1 keeps the original matrix untransformed; values
less than one compress distances along the vector; and 0 is the same as "reject,"
eliminating a vector entirely. Values less than zero will do some type of mirror-image
universe thing, but probably aren't useful?

\examples{
closest_to(demo_vectors,"sweet")

# Stretch out the vectorspace 4x longer along the gender direction.
more_sexist = distend(demo_vectors, ~ "man" + "he" - "she" -"woman", 4)

closest_to(more_sexist,"sweet")
