\title{Return a vector rejection for each element in a VectorSpaceModel}
\usage{
reject(matrix, vector)
}
\arguments{
\item{matrix}{A matrix or VectorSpaceModel}

\item{vector}{A vector (or an object coercable to a vector, see project)
of the same length as the VectorSpaceModel.}
}
\value{
A new matrix or VectorSpaceModel of the same dimensions as `matrix`,
each row of which is orthogonal to the `vector` object.

This is defined simply as `matrix-project(matrix,vector)`, but having a separate
name may make for cleaner code.

See `project` for more details.
